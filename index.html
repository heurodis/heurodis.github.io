<hr>

<p>
  Dover Forest is a 33-hectare secondary forest situated between Commonwealth Avenue West, Clementi Road, Ghim Moh Link, and Ulu Pandan canal. After the British established themselves in Singapore in 1819, the Dover Forest area probably came under the ownership of Malaccan merchant Tan Kim Seng as part of his vast holdings covering Pasir Panjang to the south. The primary forest cover was cleared for rubber and possibly gambier plantations. Between 1900 to 1910, Anxi Hokkiens moved into the area and set up kampongs north and south of the Sungei Ulu Pandan (now the concretised Ulu Pandan canal). The last of the descendants of these pioneering villagers moved out in the early 1980s, after which the present Dover Forest took shape as the secondary forest we see today - Albizia trees colonised the land alongside abandoned fruit trees such as durian, longan and mango, and other trees like Tembusu and various fig species that were probably left untouched by the kampong villagers.
</p>

<p>
  The present forest is divided into western and eastern patches by a mowed grass lawn and a covered walkway linking Dover MRT station and Ulu Pandan canal.
</p>

<p>
  <b>Did you know?</b> The name "Dover Forest" was probably first used in 2013 in <a href="http://lkcnhm.nus.edu.sg/app/uploads/2017/06/2013nis073-083.pdf">this paper</a> by Louise Neo et al. Titled "The Vascular Plant Flora of Dover Forest", it provides a good and concise history of Dover Forest in its introduction, a checklist of the forest's plants, and a good bibliography for further reading.

<h2>The situation</h2>

<p>
  It was announced in December 2020 that HDB would be <a href="https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/housing/hdb-to-launch-17000-bto-flats-in-2021-including-in-bidadari-queenstown-and-geylang">offering new Built-To-Order (BTO) flats</a> in Ulu Pandan estate in 2021. While the specific site within the estate was not disclosed, evidence and speculation pointed to a plot within the eastern patch of the forest, adjacent to Ghim Moh Link and Ulu Pandan canal. The strongest evidence were the <a href="https://www.hdb.gov.sg/-/media/doc/BIG/ulu-pandan-estate.pdf?la=en">Environmental Baseline Study</a> of the Dover Forest area conducted in 2017 by HDB, and the 2019 URA Master Plan that <a href="mp210305.png">marked the whole of the forest for development</a> - vastly for residential use and the rest for a school, a park and some roads. On the other hand, speculation came in many forms, not least that of property websites like <a href="https://www.99.co/blog/singapore/ulu-pandan-bto-flats-2021-prices-hdb/">this one</a> giving their take on the December BTO announcement.
</p>

<p>
  Nature lovers and environmentalists were sparked to life by the realisation that the forest would soon be cleared. HDB started gathering public feedback on the matter from 20 December 2020 to 16 January 2021. An <a href="https://www.change.org/p/a-campaign-to-protect-dover-forest">online petition</a> to HDB was started in early January 2021. Nature Society Singapore published an <a href="https://www.nss.org.sg/report/74c3e308-3Nature%20Society%20Feedback%20on%20HDB%20Dover%20Forest-Ulu%20Pandan%20Baseline%20Study.pdf">open feedback to HDB</a> on 15 January 2021, proposing that the forest be conserved. In a <a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/parliament/videos/february/christopher-de-souza-and-tan-kiat-how-on-preserving-dover-forest-14089624">parliamentary speech</a> on 2 February 2021, MP for Ulu Pandan ward Mr Christopher de Souza supported the forest's conservation while putting forward an alternative plan for development within his ward. HDB extended their feedback deadline to 1 March 2021.
</p>

<p>
  As it now stands, the dust is settling on the feedback-to-HDB front, the feedback deadline having closed on March 1st. The fate of Dover Forest hangs in the balance awaiting the decision makers' verdict.
</p>


<h2>About</h2>

<p>
  My name is <a href="https://www.facebook.com/chintat.chua">Chua Chin Tat</a>, and I created this website on 12 February 2021 to collect together the resources to support the conservation of Dover Forest. I am educating myself about the <a href="https://www.cam.ac.uk/stories/dasguptareview">economics of biodiversity</a>, the biodiversity of Singapore's secondary regrowth forests, local and international law with regard to biodiversity, and the history of land use in Singapore (my apologies for the repetitiveness - biodiversity is the key word here). My interest in Dover Forest stems from a lifelong love of nature and a personal attachment to the place - my great-grandfather Chua Kun Tia was one of a group of Anxi Hokkiens surnamed Chua who settled the area as a kampong in around 1905. I hope that an awareness of the rich natural and cultural heritage of Dover Forest would lead to its conservation and protection.
</p>

<p>
  My push for Dover Forest's conservation consists of the following projects:
  <ol>
    <li><a href="#heritagetree">Heritage Trees</a>
    <li><a href="#forestoffigs">Forest of Figs</a>
    <li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/chintat.chua/posts/1996341243866537">Economics of Biodiversity</a>
    <li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo/?fbid=1967883930045602&set=a.599564350210907">Cultural Heritage of Dover Forest</a>
  </ol>
  I'll be creating separate sections on this page elaborating on the latter two projects as soon as I can.
</p>

<p>
  On 28 February 2021, I submitted <a href="https://www.facebook.com/chintat.chua/posts/1975794169254578">my feedback to HDB</a> on the imminent development of the forest, highlighting the presence within the forest of large and probably irreplaceable trees, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/chintat.chua/posts/1968519833315345">endangered flora</a> and fauna that were completely missed by HDB in their environmetal baseline study of the area, and also the cultural heritage of the place.
</p>

<p>
  From March 2021 onwards I will be futher developing this site, improving and expanding on the gallery and the annotated list of literature and other resources on the science of forest conservation and the history of the Dover Forest area, and adding more resources for hikers who want to experience the forest for themselves.
</p>

  Heritage Tree Project
</h1>

<p>
  The <a href="https://www.nparks.gov.sg/sbg/our-gardens/heritage-trees">Heritage Tree Scheme</a> began in 2001 to conserve Singapore's mature trees and to educate the public about the importance such conservation work. Any member of the public can <a href="https://www.nparks.gov.sg/gardens-parks-and-nature/heritage-trees/heritage-tree-nomination-form">nominate a tree</a> for endorsement as Heritage Tree. After receiving a nomination, NParks will arrange for an arborist to inspect the nominee before submitting the nomination to the Heritage Tree Panel. The Panel exercises the final decision in conferring Heritage Tree status to the nominee. If endorsed as a Heritage Tree, the nominee becomes protected and enjoys many perks that come with its lofty new status, including lightning conductors and interpretive signages.
</p>

<p>
  The <a href="https://www.hdb.gov.sg/-/media/doc/BIG/ulu-pandan-estate.pdf?la=en">Enrironmental Baseline Study for Dover / Ulu Pandan</a> (the "EBS") listed 27 "large trees of significance" within Dover Forest (on pages 64 and 65). According to the EBS these large trees are "conservation-significant" because of "the potential of long-term ecosystem service provision by large tree species (e.g., thermal cooling, carbon sequestration, fauna habitat/food source)". The aim of the Heritage Tree project is to raise the conservation value of Dover Forest by getting some of these large and representative trees endorsed as Heritage Trees.
</p>

<p>
  In February 2021, I visited some of these 27 large trees of significance, photographing them and measuring them for girth - I thought that they must have grown since they were last measured by the EBS surveyors four years ago in 2017. Then, over two days from 26 to 27 February 2021, I submitted to the National Parks Board (NParks) my first five Heritage Tree nominees. In my <a href="https://www.facebook.com/chintat.chua/posts/1975794169254578">final feedback to HDB</a> for the conservation of Dover Forest just a day before the 1st March 2021 deadline, I made sure to feature these five nominees prominently, highlighting the presence of old and conservation-worthy trees within the forest.
</p>

<p>
  Since then, I have continued seeking out the larger and more significant trees in Dover Forest, and nominating those that I felt would stand a good chance of being endorsed as Heritage Trees. The 2021 Heritage Tree Scheme cycle closes on 30 June 2021, and there is plenty of time yet to get more of Dover Forest's giants nominated as Heritage Trees!
</p>

<p>
  Here are all of my Heritage Tree nominees, as of 24 March 2021:
</p>

  Updates
</h2>

<p>
  <b>[8 Mar 2021]</b> I was pleasantly surprised by a call from an NParks staff, telling me that the first five of my nominations had been received, and asking if I could help to guide them to those that were deeper inside Dover Forest. I replied that I could do so on weekends as I had a day job to take care of. The NParks staffer thanked me and very helpfully set up a WhatsApp chat with me after this conversation. I wrote a brief (well, not so brief) guide on how to find my five nominees on the ground at Dover Forest in a <a href="NParks210308.jpg">flurry of texts</a>. NParks staffer promised to keep in touch.
</p>

<p>
  <b>[13-19 Mar 2021]</b> I was pleasantly surprised to discover that I'll be having a week off work in April to moonlight as a forest ranger! I texted this happy news to the NParks staffer, who thanked me and would "let me know". Later discovering that I had made a mistake with my dates, I texted the staffer again with the correction. This time, <a href="NParks21031319.jpg">no response</a>.
</p>

<p>
  <b>[25 Mar 2021]</b> No update from NParks since 13 March. Meantime I've made two more Heritage Tree nominations, for a total of 7. I hope they have gotten to work secretly with the aim of giving me some pleasant surprises.

  Forest of Figs Project
</h1>

<p>
  Dover Forest is habitat to a surprising diversity of figs - from the breathtaking stranglers that twist and wind their way both down towards the earth and up into the sky, and the free standing ones that put out conspicuous bunches of fruit on their trunks, to the less showy species that never develop a tree-like trunk but instead climb up other trees to reach the sun above the forest canopy.
</p>

<p>
  Since February this year when I started exploring Dover Forest and advocating for its conservation, I have become convinced that I must tell the story of the forest's amazing diversity of figs and of their importance as a keystone food resource for a wide variety of animals. The idea is that when the important role of the forest and its figs in supporting Singapore's biodiversity becomes clear, so then will it also become clear that its conservation will serve us more than its destruction, in the great balance of things. That's the main and pragmatic and immediate reason for this project. The other reason is that such a synthesis would be too exciting not to try - to put together something scientifically sound out of all <a href="https://www.facebook.com/chintat.chua/posts/1993695724131089">my encounters</a> with the fascinating figs of Dover Forest.
</p>

<p>
  More to come, definitely. Meanwhile, some readings, videos and pictures:

    <li><a href="https://www.roots.gov.sg/stories-landing/stories/a-fabulous-fig-tree/story">A Fabulous Fig Tree</a>. This article introduces the concept of a "keystone species" in ecology and how figs play such a role in our local context. It describes the botany of figs, including the peculiar obligatory and mutualistic relationship between figs and fig wasps. Highly recommended as a layman's introduction to Singapore's figs.

      HDB's Environmental Baseline Study
    </a>
      The report of a 2017 HDB-commissioned environmental study of the Dover Forest site, this is the go-to document for anyone who wants to know more about the biodiversity of Dover Forest. Consists of three distinct studies of the flora, fauna and hydrology of the site. Quite impressive in scope, but the fauna section is very lacking in terms of insects - which is disappointing considering their foundational role in ecosystems.

  I am on a personal project to identify and nominate trees in Dover Forest as <a href="https://www.nparks.gov.sg/gardens-parks-and-nature/heritage-trees">Heritage Trees</a> to boost its conservation value. I now have two such trees in mind - the magnificent strangler fig near Dover MRT station (first picture in Gallery below), and a large tree overlooking a private forest farm in the northwest of the western patch. I plan to identify these two trees and have them measured for girth and height sometime in the third week of February 2021. More on this soon.

<h2>
  1. The Dover Forest Heritage Tree Project
</h2>

<p>
  The <a href="https://www.hdb.gov.sg/-/media/doc/BIG/ulu-pandan-estate.pdf?la=en">Enrironmental Baseline Study for Dover / Ulu Pandan</a> (the "EBS") listed 27 "large trees of significance" within Dover Forest (on pages 64 and 65). According to the EBS, along with those it categorised as threatened species, such trees are "conservation-significant" because of "the potential of long-term ecosystem service provision by large tree species (e.g., thermal cooling, carbon sequestration, fauna habitat/food source)".
</p>

<p>
  In the EBS, a tree qualifies as a large tree of significance if it meets the following criteria:
  <ul>
    <li>woody stem with girth greater than 2 m
    <li>good physiological health and structure, i.e. not prone to failure
    <li>no potential of becoming an invasive species
    <li>not of a species known for being structurally weak
  </ul>
</p>

<p>
  My plan is to nominate some of these large trees of significance as Heritage Trees. The <a href="https://www.nparks.gov.sg/sbg/our-gardens/heritage-trees">Heritage Tree Scheme</a> began in 2001 to conserve our mature trees and to educate people about the importance such conservation work. Basically, <a href="https://www.nparks.gov.sg/gardens-parks-and-nature/heritage-trees/heritage-tree-nomination-form">we get to nominate trees</a> amongst our midst for Heritage Tree status. NParks receives the nominations and sends arborists to inspect the nominees before presenting them to the Heritage Tree Panel, which decides whether to endorse our nominees as Heritage Trees. Should they become endorsed, our nominees will become protected and get lots of perks that come with their lofty new status, including lightning conductors and interpretive signages. Finally, the fact that Dover Forest contains such Heritage Trees will surely boost its conservation value in the eyes of everyone.
</p>

<p>
  I have fed the coordinates of the 27 large trees of significance into <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/edit?mid=1VacjBhnZclHLDRa2kY_77kWHa7YbS4oI&usp=sharing">Google Maps</a>, and will be visiting the larger ones such as the critically endangered <i>Ficus virens</i> (10.99m girth in the EBS) to photogragh them and take new measurements - the EBS was conducted in 2017, its data is 4 years old now and these trees must have grown even thicker and taller!<br>
</p>

<p>
  On the other hand, I am manually trawling NParks' <a href="https://www.nparks.gov.sg/gardens-parks-and-nature/heritage-trees">Heritage Tree Register</a> of over 300 Heritage Trees for data such as species, girth, height, age and location, and <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1sFXuMzbf332d55oB9UmjI5_Jja5DzurL/view?usp=sharing">compiling a spreadsheet of such data</a>. There are several reasons for this, chief amongst which are:
  <ul>
    <li>such a spreadsheet that provides a bird's eye view of all endorsed Heritage Trees is not publicly available at the moment
    <li>to give us a feel about the chances of our nominees, as the Heritage Tree qualifying criteria isn't too clear - girth of &gt;5m and&sol;or "botanical, social, historical, cultural and&sol;or aesthetical value" - while the latter is understandably wishy-washy, the former isn't as absolute as it seems because an examination of the Register will immediately reveal that there are a lot of Heritage Trees that do not meet the 5m criterion.
    <li>to help us judge the age of our nominees based on the data of Heritage Trees of same species - tree age helps promote our nominees but is difficult to determine by a non-comparative method
  </ul>
  This spreadsheet is a work in progress - as of 16 Feb 2021 it contains data for 90 out of approximately 300 Heritage Trees in the Register.
</p>

<p>
  I will be updating my progress regularly, and I would like to hear from you if you wish to <a href="http://m.me/chintat.chua">make a suggestion or contribute in any way</a>. The hard deadline I have set myself is Friday 26 Feb 2021, on which date I will submit my nomminees to NParks through their website - the extended public consultation period on Dover Forest ends on 1 Mar 2021 and I will be including my Heritage Tree candidates in my <a href="https://services2.hdb.gov.sg/survey/se/16DCE1662C45E2FE">feedback to HDB</a> for the forest's conservation.
</p>

<p>
  If time and energy permit, I will extend this project to cover the endangered trees listed in the EBS - these are also "conservation-significant" along with the large trees of significance I'm now focusing on.
</p>

<p>
<b>Updates</b>
</p>
<p>
[16 Feb 2021] Visited and measured the girth of six of the EBS' Large Trees of Significance in the eastern patch - those along Commonwealth Avenue West between the underpass and the slip road into Ghim Moh Link, and the durian tree near the left boundary of the eastern patch. A piece of string was put around each tree at breast height and the length of this string was then measured to obtain the girth. Of the three Senegal Mahoganys (<i>K. senegalensis</i>) along Commonwealth Avenue West, one had been felled about two years ago and I could not locate another. A large Albizia (<i>F. moluccana</i>) near the canal end of the covered walkway between Dover MRT station and Ulu Pandan canal has been added to my list of potential Heritage Tree nominees. This specimen is of impressive girth (3.7m) and height and has a very extensive crown and root network. Have updated the <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/edit?mid=1VacjBhnZclHLDRa2kY_77kWHa7YbS4oI&usp=sharing">map</a> with pictures and common names, and created <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/edit?mid=1j2MFa32q9tr-grxBM06mUNRYMuGfm-jy&usp=sharing">another map</a> for large trees not included in the EBS, and also this <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Dv7snhOBzCj2pk5yff-PhN1P278vC4Wh/view?usp=sharing">spreadsheet</a> of data for all potential Heritage Tree nominees.

  2. The Dover Forest History Project
</h2>

<p>
  Dover Forest (33 hectares; 0.33 km<sup>2</sup>) was probably part of an Ulu Pandan Nature Reserve (1370 acres; 5.5km<sup>2</sup>) a long time ago in the 1950s. I am on a mission to trawl up as much information as I can on this Ulu Pandan Nature Reserve - the idea is to show that we have to preserve what's left of it (Dover Forest) given that we have already destroyed almost all trace of it both physically and historically.
</p>

<p>
  I found out about the nature reserve by accident. While googling around for Dover Forest's history, I found <a href="https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/infopedia/articles/SIP_2016-10-03_092727.html">this very interesting article</a> about Ulu Pandan's at the NLB (National Library Board) website. The article mentions the nature reserve: "In 1957, the Legislative Assembly passed a motion to convert 1,000 ac of mangroves in the Ulu Pandan nature reserve into prawn ponds". This intrigued me for two reasons - because we can leverage this knowledge for the conservation of Dover Forest, and because although I am personally invested in uncovering the history of Dover Forest and Ulu Pandan (my father was one of the kampongers living in what is now the forest's eastern patch in the 1950s and 60s), I knew nothing about the nature reserve.
</p>

<p>
  After attacking the article and its references, I now have this story for the history buffs:
</p>

<i>
<p>
  In 1957 in the Singapore Legislative Assembly, the Minister for Commerce and Industry introduced a motion to convert 1000 acres of the 1370-acre Ulu Pandan nature preserve into prawn farms and ponds. He said that "the preservation of the flora and fauna of Singapore must take second place to the preservation of the human species."
</p>
<p>
  A 3-hour debate ensued, during which the Minister for Communications and Works warned, "It is illusory to imagine that, under the pressure of population it is possible to preserve nature reserves. The most we can do is to delay the encroachment."
</p>
<p>
  It wasn't all one-way though, as the opposition put forward a two-pronged argument, voicing "grave doubts" about any resulting increase in food yield in the form of prawns for the Colony, and proposing that the preserve be kept intact for the benefit of science and education.
</p>
<p>
  At the end of the day, the Assembly approved the motion. Back then even nature preserve status didn't guarantee conservation.
</p>
<p>
  Fast forward 64 years to where we are now in 2021. The 33-hectare (81.5 acres) Dover Forest is up for development. This is a mere 5.9% of the original 1370 acres of the then Ulu Pandan nature preserve. The preserve and its mangroves are gone never to return. I am convinced we have to preserve this precious patch we still have left. I am of the belief that we have to clean up the forest, restore its nature preserve status and let nature do the rest and continue to regenerate. I am also hopeful because we live in more enlightened times.
</p>
</i>

<p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/chintat.chua/posts/1962245257276136">My FaceBook post on this story</a></p>

<p>
  So this is a project to extend on and polish the above story right up to my self-imposed hard deadline of 26 Feb 2021 when I will submit it as part of my <a href="https://services2.hdb.gov.sg/survey/se/16DCE1662C45E2FE">feedback to HDB</a> for the forest's conservation (the end of the extended public consultation on Dover Forest's future is on the 1st of March). I will be updating my progress regularly, and I would like to hear from you if you wish to <a href="http://m.me/chintat.chua">make a suggestion or contribute in any way</a>.
</p>

<p>
<b>Updates</b>
</p>
<p>
[17 Feb 2021] I now have a powerful tool to help delineate the old Ulu Pandan Nature Reserve - <a href="https://search.nlb.gov.sg/spatialdiscovery/app/?fbclid=IwAR1UgWKR_bjgXOS8F652q3pQeiwpVyNTrmbDojFhVhwuI9VeaLBHMZscjeM">NLB's Spatial Discovery App</a>. According to Marcus Ng who so kindly pointed me to this resource, it can be used to compare "historical maps and present-day Singapore, to trace land-use".  Which was what I did for the better part of the day - selecting from NLB's collection of 612 maps from the 1950s and then superimposing relevant ones onto a present-day Google map of Singapore to finally sieve out 34 maps that can help trace the history of Dover Forest and the long gone Pandan Nature Reserve. Going through these maps has made realise that 1. Dover Forest was never part of the Pandan Nature Reserve which was centred between Sungei Jurong and Sungei Pandan (as Marcus has also pointed out to me yesterday), 2. <a href="https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/infopedia/articles/SIP_2016-10-03_092727.html#:~:text=Ulu%20Pandan%20is%20named%20after,trees%20found%20along%20the%20riverbanks.">Pandan Nature Reserve is probably synonymous with Ulu Pandan Nature Reserve</a>. The latter name never appears on the maps I've seen today, while the former never appears on newspaper articles like <a href="https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/Digitised/Article/straitstimes19571205-1.2.46">this one</a> and <a href="https://www.nas.gov.sg/archivesonline/speeches/record-details/519a36f4-bc60-11e6-b045-0050568939ad">parliamentary documents</a> from the 50's. 3. Having never been part of the Pandan Nature Reserve does not detract much from Dover Forest's conservation value. Having not been human-occupied for decades since the last of the kampongers including my father's family moved out in the 80s, the area has been slowly reclaimed by nature and should be given a chance to regenerate. I will be educating myself in the conservation value of non-pristine secondary forests like this one over the next few days to support my feedback to HDB for its conservation. This map-trawling exercise has far from been in vain - the sobering story of the disappearance of the Pandan Nature Reserve should serve to give us pause before demolishing Dover Forest. I will see that its story gets developed and told. Sincere thanks to Marcus for making this research possible.<br><br>

"Pandan Nature Reserve" is labelled west of Sungei Jurong but could encompass the entire mangroves surrounding and in between Sungei Jurong and Sungei Pandan. In the present Dover Forest area, the Chinese temple has disappeared and more buildings have appeared either side of the main track.)
